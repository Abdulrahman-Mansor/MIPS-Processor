### Introduction:
This microprogram is designed to multiply two numbers using loops and then verify the result by dividing the obtained product by the second number. It performs arithmetic operations using the MIPS assembly instructions represented in machine code.

| Machine Code | Description                            |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| x"7003"      | Load Immediate $r0 with 3              |
| x"720A"      | Load Immediate $r1 with 10             |
| x"7400"      | Load Immediate $r2 with 0              |
| x"7E00"      | Load Immediate $r7 with 0              |
| x"1290"      | $r2 = $r2 + $r1                        |
| x"3001"      | $r0 = $r0 - 1                          |
| x"B1C4"      | Branch to 4 if $r0 > $r7 (x"1290")     |
| x"145B"      | $r3 = $r2 / $r1                        |
